## Question

Scales, shapes (line/area/bar/arc/pie/radial/stack/sankey), axes, grid, labels, hover and appear animation render as upstream.

## Scope

- Base files: plot/**. Pure parts (scales, stack, pie, sankey, arc geometry: 44 tests) can start immediately; rendering needs the paint API and the shape-line facade.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every ported behavior cites the pinned Base source (`upstream-base/ce/crates/base/src/...`, c0820693) or the core pin (`reference/ce-source/crates/gpui/src/...`, 254b5dbd); no invented APIs.
- [ ] Upstream tests in scope are ported (count ported / deviated / not-applicable recorded with reasons); real-window tests FAIL rather than skip.
- [ ] No native artifact change (rev 11 stays frozen); any genuine native need is stopped and surfaced to the user with evidence.
- [ ] `CGO_ENABLED=0 go test` for the touched packages is green, `go vet` + gofmt clean, and the core regression packages stay green; executed evidence in `evidence/base/ticketNN-*.json`.

## Comments

- 2026-10-19 — Created by the GPUI Base port chat from the merged slice inventories (R: = `reference/ce-source/crates/gpui/src`).
- 2026-10-22 — Claimed by the base-port-2 orchestrator and delegated.
